**[Combining CSG modeling with soft blending using Lipschitz-based implicit surfaces](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-002-0198-3)**  
Describes CSG modelling, how soft blending can be used in conjunction and a bunch of other interesting/related topics.

**[Sphere tracing: a geometric method for the antialiased ray tracing of implicit surfaces](https://doi.org/10.1007/s003710050084)**  
Describes sphere tracing: the primary method of rendering in this project, and how it can be utilized to achieve various effects. Useful but verbose resource.
